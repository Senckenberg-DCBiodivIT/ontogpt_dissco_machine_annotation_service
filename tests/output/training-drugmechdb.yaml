    Text:

    Loracarbef is an oral, synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbacephem class.
    Chemically, carbacephems differ from cephalosporin-class antibiotics in the dihydrothiazine
    ring where a methylene group has been substituted for a sulfur atom. Loracarbef
    has a spectrum of activity similar to that of the second generation cephalosporins.
    It is structurally identical to cefaclor except for a sulfur atom that has been
    replaced by a methylene group. This change gives greater chemical stability in
    solution and allows storage at room temperature. Loracarbef, like all b-lactams
    and cephalosporins, inhibits penicillin binding proteins, enzymes that create
    the cross-linkage of the peptidoglycan polymer. This binding leads to interference
    with the formation and remodeling of the cell wall structure.

    Pralidoxime is an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals. Organophosphates

    acetylcholine to accumulate in synapses, producing continuous stimulation of cholinergic
    fibers throughout the nervous systems. If given within 24 hours after organophosphate
    exposure, pralidoxime reactivates the acetylcholinesterase by cleaving the phosphate-ester
    bond formed between the organophosphate and acetylcholinesterase.

    Text:

    Dopamine is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also
    a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system. Dopamine produces
    positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased
    heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting
    an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine
    from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings. In the brain, dopamine actas
    as an agonist to the five dopamine receptor subtypes (D!, D2, D3, D4, D5).

    As mentioned above, torasemide is part of the loop diuretics and thus, it acts
    by reducing the oxygen demand in the medullary thick ascending loop of Henle by
    inhibiting the Na+/K+/Cl- pump on the luminal cell membrane surface.[A174466]
    This action is obtained by the binding of torasemide to a chloride ion-binding
    site of the transport molecule.[L5257] Torasemide is known to have an effect in
    the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by inhibiting the downstream cascade
    after the activation of angiotensin II. This inhibition will produce a secondary
    effect marked by the reduction of the expression of aldosterone synthase, TGF-B1
    and thromboxane A2 and a reduction on the aldosterone receptor binding.[A174466,

    The dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein
    coupled receptor associated with G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; proteins. In lactotrophs,

    adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks
    IP3-dependent release of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from intracellular stores.
    Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition
    of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition
    of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation
    of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK
    appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase.
    Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated

    Glucocorticoids inhibit neutrophil apoptosis and demargination, and inhibit NF-Kappa
    B and other inflammatory transcription factors.[A187463] They also inhibit phospholipase
    A2, leading to decreased formation of arachidonic acid derivatives.[A187463] In
    addition, glucocorticoids promote anti-inflammatory genes like interleukin-10.[A187463]
    Corticosteroids like betamethasone can act through nongenomic and genomic pathways.[A31458]
    The genomic pathway is slower and occurs when glucocorticoids activate glucocorticoid
    receptors and initiate downstream effects that promote transcription of anti-inflammatory
    genes including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), IL-1-receptor antagonist,
    and tyrosine amino transferase (TAT).[A31458] On the other hand, the nongenomic
    pathway is able to elicit a quicker response by modulating T-cell, platelet and

    Colestipol is a lipid-lowering polymer that binds with bile acids in the intestine
    forming a complex that is excreted in the feces [FDA Label, F4555, F4567]. This
    non-systemic action results in a continuous, partial removal of bile acids from
    the enterohepatic circulation preventing their reabsorption [FDA Label, F4555,
    F4567]. This increased fecal loss of bile acids due to colestipol hydrochloride
    administration leads to increased oxidation of cholesterol to bile acids [FDA
    Label, F4555, F4567]. This results in an increase in the number of hepatic low-density
    lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, and consequently an increased uptake of LDL and a
    decrease in serum/plasma beta lipoprotein or total and LDL cholesterol levels
    [FDA Label, F4555, F4567]. Although hydrochloride produces an increase in the
    hepatic synthesis of cholesterol in man, serum cholesterol levels fall [FDA Label,

    Text:

    The HIV lifecycle is comprised of 3 distinct stages: assembly, involving creation
    and packaging of essential viral components; budding, wherein the viral particle
    crosses the host cell plasma membrane and forms a lipid envelope; and maturation,
    wherein the viral particle alters its structure and becomes infectious.[A191712]
    At the center of this lifecycle is the Gag polyprotein which, along with the products
    of its proteolysis, coordinate these stages and function as the major structural
    proteins of the virus. The HIV-1 protease enzyme, a dimeric aspartic protease,
    is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein and thus plays a critical
    role in many aspects of the HIV viral lifecycle.[A191712] Lopinavir is an inhibitor
    of the HIV-1 protease enzyme.[L11163] Its design is based on the "peptidomimetic"
    principle, wherein the molecule contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold which mimics
    the normal peptide linkage (cleaved by HIV protease) but which itself cannot be
    cleaved.[A191757] By preventing HIV-1 protease activity, and thus the proteolysis
    of the Gag polyprotein, lopinavir results in the production of immature, non-infectious
    viral particles.

    Sulfinpyrazone is an oral uricosuric agent (pyrazolone derivative) used to treat
    chronic or intermittent gouty arthritis. Sulfinpyrazone competitively inhibits
    the reabsorption of uric acid at the proximal convoluted tubule, thereby facilitating
    urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing plasma urate concentrations.  This
    is likely done through inhibition of the urate anion transporter (hURAT1) as well
    as the human organic anion transporter 4 (hOAT4). Sulfinpyrazone is not intended
    for the treatment of acute attacks because it lacks therapeutically useful analgesic
    and anti-inflammatory effects. Sulfinpyrazone and its sulfide metabolite possess
    COX inhibitory effects. Sulfinpyrazone has also been shown to be a UDP-glucuronsyltransferase
    inhibitor and a very potent CYP2C9 inhibitor.  Sulfinpyrazone is also known to

    Text:

    Pixantrone is an aza-anthracenedione which acts as a DNA intercalator. By intercalating
    between DNA, with modest affinity, it stimulates DNA cleavage by topoisomerase
    II. (Pixantrone acts as a poison to topoisomerase II by stabilizing protein-DNA
    complexes which are usually transient, giving rise to double stranded DNA breaks.)
    The first line agent doxorubicin is cardiotoxic, in part, due to its ability to
    redox activate the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, and form a long-lived
    secondary alcohol metabolite: doxorubicinol. [3] Clearance of doxorubicin from
    myocardial tissue is incomplete, and it can be found months or years after the
    last administration. [3] In doxorubicin treated ex vivo cardiac strips, pixantrone
    formed an N-dealkylated product that inhibited metabolism of residual doxorubicin
    into doxorubicinol. Additionally, in ex vivo human myocardial strips (doxorubicin
    naive, and doxorubicin pretreated) pixantrone showed high cardiac uptake without
    formation of superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide. Pixantrones lack of cardiotoxicity
    is thus attributed to its redox inactivity and inhibition of doxorubicinol formation.

    Text:

    As a diagnostic agent, inulin is readily soluble and essentially indigestible.
    It readily passes through the blood and into the urine. It is neither secreted
    nor resorbed by the kidney making it an excellent indicator for renal clearance
    rates. The inulin clearance test has largely been succeeded by the creatinine
    clearance test as a measure of glomerular filtration rate.  Inulin is a hypoglycemic
    agent. Since it is not digestible by human enzymes ptyalin and amylase, inulin
    passes through much of the digestive system intact. It is only in the colon that
    bacteria metabolise inulin, with the release of significant quantities of carbon
    dioxide and/or methane. Because inulin is not broken down into simple sugars (monosaccharides)
    by normal digestion, it does not elevate blood sugar levels, hence, helping diabetics

    which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis.[A959] Endocytic
    vesicles become acidified, releasing bisphosphonates into the cytosol of osteoclasts
    where they act.[A959] Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates such as pamidronate
    are known to induce apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells by inhibiting the components
    of the mevalonate pathway farnesyl diphosphate synthase, farnesyl diphosphate,
    and geranylgeranyl diphosphate.[A202769,A203123,A203111] These components are
    essential for post-translational prenylation of GTP-binding proteins like Rap1.[A202769,A203123]
    The lack of prenylation of these proteins interferes with their function, and
    in the case of Rap1, leads to apoptosis.[A202769,A203123] pamidronate also activated
    caspases 3 and 9 which further contribute to apoptosis.[A202769,A203123,A203177]

    Text:

    Levosimendan appears to increase myofilament calcium sensitivity by binding to
    cardiac troponin C in a calcium-dependent manner. This stabilizes the calcium-induced
    conformational change of troponin C, thereby (1) changing actin-myosin cross-bridge
    kinetics apparently without increasing the cycling rate of the cross-bridges or
    myocardial ATP consumption, (2) increasing the effects of calcium on cardiac myofilaments
    during systole and (3) improving contraction at low energy cost (inotropic effect).
    Calcium concentration and, therefore, sensitization decline during diastole, allowing
    normal or improved diastolic relaxation. Levosimendan also leads to vasodilation
    through the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. By these inotropic and
    vasodilatory actions, levosimendan increases cardiac output without increasing
    myocardial oxygen demand. Levosimendan also has a selective phosphodiesterase
    (PDE)-III inhibitory action that may contribute to the inotropic effect of this
    compound under certain experimental conditions. It has been reported that levosimendan
    may act preferentially as a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensitizer at lower concentrations,
    whereas at higher concentrations its action as a PDE-III inhibitor becomes more
    prominent in experimental animals and humans.

    Text:

    Prostaglandins are present in most body tissues and fluids and mediate many biological
    functions. Epoprostenol (PGI2) is a member of the family of prostaglandins that
    is derived from arachidonic acid. The major pharmacological actions of epoprostenol
    is ultimately inhibition of platelet aggregation. Prostacycline (PGI2) from endothelial
    cells activate G protein-coupled receptors on platelets and endothelial cells.
    This activation causes adenylate cyclase to produce cyclic AMP which inhibits
    further platelet activation and activates protein kinase A. Cyclic AMP also prevents
    coagulation by preventing an increase in intracellular calcium from thromboxane
    A2 binding. PKA then continues the cascade by phosphorylating and inhibiting myosin
    light-chain kinase which leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Notably,
    PGI2 and TXA2 work as physiological antagonists.

    There is also an AT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor found in many tissues but

    Its affinity for the AT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor is 1,000 times greater

    Text:

    The prevention of dental caries by topical fluoride is achieved by various mechanisms.[A181703]
    Sodium fluoride kills bacteria that cause caries, such a Streptococcus mutans
    and lactobacilli[A181718] by interfering with their metabolic activities that
    result in the formation of lactic acid. Fluoride ions cause the inhibition of
    glycolytic and other enzymes involved in bacterial metabolism. It changes the
    permeability of cell membranes, lowering the pH in the cytoplasm of the cell,
    leading to a decrease in acidity, which is normally implicated in tooth decay.[A181652]   When
    administered at low topical doses, fluoride in both saliva and plaque and saliva
    prevent the demineralization of healthy tooth enamel while remineralizing teeth
    that have previously been demineralized. Sodium fluoride is absorbed by the surface
    of hydroxyapatite crystals on the teeth, which are necessary for mineralization.
    This renders the teeth more resistant to demineralization by changing the apatite
    crystal solubility.[A181670,A181694] Sodium fluoride inhibits the demineralization
    of teeth in a pH-related manner. When used in high doses, in formulations such
    as the fluoride varnishes or gels, sodium fluoride forms a layer on the surface
    of tooth enamel. When the pH of the mouth is reduced due to acid production by
    bacteria such as S.mutans, fluoride is released, interfering with bacterial metabolism,
    and then acts to remineralize the teeth.[A181652,A181694,L7688]

    Alkylating agents work by three different mechanisms: 1) attachment of alkyl groups
    to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their
    attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription
    from the affected DNA, 2) DNA damage via the formation of cross-links (bonds between
    atoms in the DNA) which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription,
    and 3) the induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations.

    Text:

    Doxepin exact mechanism of action is not very clear. However, doxepin is known
    to be a selective histamine H1 receptor blocker.[A177163] This effect on histamine
    receptors indicates effectiveness in skin conditions.[T249] It is known that the
    lack of dopamine transporters in the frontal cortex and the transmission of dopamine
    in this region is largely inactivated by the effect of norepinephrine reuptake.
    Hence, doxepin action on the frontal cortex is suggested to increase dopamine
    neurotransmission in this area.[T249]

    \n\nText:\nAcetylcysteine protects against acetaminophen overdose-induced hepatotoxicity\
    \ by maintaining or restoring hepatic concentrations of glutathione. It does this\
    \ by producing the glutathione precursor L-cysteine. Glutathione is required to\
    \ inactivate an intermediate metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine or NAPQI)\
    \ of acetaminophen that is thought to be hepatotoxic. In acetaminophen overdose\
    \ cases, excessive quantities of this metabolite are formed because the primary\
    \ metabolic (glucuronide and sulfate conjugation) pathways become saturated. Acetylcysteine\
    \ may act by reducing the metabolite to the parent compound and/or by providing\
    \ sulfhydryl for conjugation of the metabolite. Experimental evidence also suggests\
    \ that a sulfhydryl-containing compound such as acetylcysteine may also directly\
    \ inactivate the metabolite. The mechanisms of action for acetylcysteine\u2019\
    s well-known mucolytic effects are different.  In particular, when inhaled, acetylcysteine\
    \ (and its metabolic byproduct cysteine) exerts its mucolytic action through its\
    \ free sulfhydryl group, which reduces the disulfide bonds in the mucus matrix\
    \ and lowers mucus viscosity. This action increases with increasing pH and is\
    \ most significant at pH 7 to 9. The mucolytic action of acetylcysteine is not\
    \ affected by the presence of DNA. Acetylcysteine is also an antioxidant and reduces\
    \ oxidative stress. Acetylcysteine serves as a prodrug to L-cysteine which is\
    \ a precursor to the biologic antioxidant, glutathione and hence administration\
    \ of acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione stores. L-cysteine also serves as\
    \ a precursor to cystine which in turn serves as a substrate for the cystine-glutamate\
    \ antiporter on astrocytes hence increasing glutamate release into the extracellular\
    \ space. This glutamate in turn acts on mGluR2/3 receptors, and at higher doses\
    \ of acetylcysteine, mGluR5. Glutathione also modulates the NMDA receptor by acting\
    \ at the redox site. These effects on glutamate and NMDA signaling appear to explain\
    \ some of the positive neuropsychotropic effects associated with NAC.  Acetylcysteine\
    \ also possesses some anti-inflammatory effects possibly via inhibiting NF-\u03BA\
    B through redox activation of the nuclear factor kappa kinases thereby modulating\

    Text:

    According to its FDA labeling, acetaminophen''s exact mechanism of action has
    not been fully established[Label] - despite this, it is often categorized alongside
    NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) due to its ability to inhibit the
    cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways.[T518] It is thought to exert central actions which
    ultimately lead to the alleviation of pain symptoms.[T518] One theory is that
    acetaminophen increases the pain threshold by inhibiting two isoforms of cyclooxygenase,
    COX-1 and COX-2, which are involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Prostaglandins
    are responsible for eliciting pain sensations.[A176366] Acetaminophen does not
    inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral
    anti-inflammatory effects. Though acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible
    inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the active site of this enzyme, studies have
    shown that acetaminophen (paracetamol) blocks COX indirectly.[F4133] Studies also
    suggest that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant type of the COX enzyme
    that is unique from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2.[A468] This enzyme has
    been referred to as _COX-3_. The antipyretic actions of acetaminophen are likely
    attributed to direct action on heat-regulating centers in the brain, resulting
    in peripheral vasodilation, sweating, and loss of body heat.[F4133] The exact
    mechanism of action of this drug is not fully understood at this time, but future
    research may contribute to deeper knowledge.[F4133]

    Text:

    Cortisone acetate binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding
    the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into
    the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE)
    in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts
    with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific
    target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to
    involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition
    arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
    Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which
    then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into
    contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid
    production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed,
    potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation
    Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids.
    Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular
    space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various
    inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis,
    respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal
    enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils,
    macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids
    due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin
    and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference
    with antigen-antibody binding.

    As a tetracycline, meclocycline likely works by reversably associating with the
    30s subint of the bacterial ribosome [A19429]. A likely binding site for tetracyclines
    has been identified on protein S7 of this subunit. This association blocks the
    association of aminoacyl-tRNA with the ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis.
    Ultimately this inhibits bacterial growth due to a lack of proteins necessary
    for reproduction.

    Tobramycin binds irreversibly to one of two aminoglycoside binding sites on the
    30 S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Tobramycin may
    also destabilize bacterial memebrane by binding to 16 S 16 S r-RNA. An active
    transport mechanism for aminoglycoside uptake is necessary in the bacteria in
    order to attain a significant intracellular concentration of tobramycin.

    Text:

    Vomiting (emesis) is essentially a protective mechanism for removing irritant
    or otherwise harmful substances from the upper GI tract. Emesis or vomiting is
    controlled by the vomiting centre in the medulla region of the brain, an important
    part of which is the chemotrigger zone (CTZ). The vomiting centre possesses neurons
    which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These
    types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus
    to the vomiting centre. Motion sickness principally involves overstimulation of
    these pathways due to various sensory stimuli. Hence the action of cyclizine which
    acts to block the histamine receptors in the vomiting centre and thus reduce activity
    along these pathways. Furthermore since cyclizine possesses anti-cholinergic properties
    as well, the muscarinic receptors are similarly blocked.

    By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial
    cell wall, penicillin G inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall
    synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes
    such as autolysins; it is possible that penicillin G interferes with an autolysin
    inhibitor.

    Text:

    The primary mechanism of action of amikacin is the same as that for all aminoglycosides.
    It binds to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunits and interferes with mRNA binding
    and tRNA acceptor sites, interfering with bacterial growth. This leads to disruption
    of normal protein synthesis and production of non-functional or toxic peptides.
    Other actions have been postulated for drugs of this class.[Label,F1949,F1950]
    Amikacin, as well as the rest of the aminoglycosides, are generally bacteriocidal
    against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.[L4680,F1954]

    Text:

    Tranexamic acid competitively inhibits activation of plasminogen (via binding
    to the kringle domain), thereby reducing conversion of plasminogen to plasmin
    (fibrinolysin), an enzyme that degrades fibrin clots, fibrinogen, and other plasma
    proteins, including the procoagulant factors V and VIII. Tranexamic acid also
    directly inhibits plasmin activity, but higher doses are required than are needed
    to reduce plasmin formation.
