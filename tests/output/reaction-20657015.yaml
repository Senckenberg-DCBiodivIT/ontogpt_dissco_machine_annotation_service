input_text: "Title: Molecular identification of N-acetylaspartylglutamate synthase\
  \ and beta-citrylglutamate synthase\n\nAbstract\nThe purpose of the present work\
  \ was to determine the identity of the enzymes that synthesize N-acetylaspartylglutamate\
  \ (NAAG), the most abundant dipeptide present in vertebrate central nervous system\
  \ (CNS), and \u03B2-citrylglutamate, a structural analogue of NAAG present in testis\
  \ and immature brain. Previous evidence suggests that NAAG is not synthesized on\
  \ ribosomes but presumably is synthesized by a ligase. As attempts to detect this\
  \ ligase in brain extracts failed, we searched the mammalian genomes for putative\
  \ enzymes that could catalyze this type of reaction. Mammalian genomes were found\
  \ to encode two putative ligases homologous to Escherichia coli RIMK, which ligates\
  \ glutamates to the C terminus of ribosomal protein S6. One of them, named RIMKLA,\
  \ is almost exclusively expressed in the CNS, whereas RIMKLB, which shares 65% sequence\
  \ identity with RIMKLA, is expressed in CNS and testis. Both proteins were expressed\
  \ in bacteria or HEK293T cells and purified. RIMKLA catalyzed the ATP-dependent\
  \ synthesis of N-acetylaspartylglutamate from N-acetylaspartate and l-glutamate.\
  \ RIMKLB catalyzed this reaction as well as the synthesis of \u03B2-citrylglutamate.\
  \ The nature of the reaction products was confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR.\
  \ RIMKLA was shown to produce stoichiometric amounts of NAAG and ADP, in agreement\
  \ with its belonging to the ATP-grasp family of ligases. The molecular identification\
  \ of these two enzymes will facilitate progress in the understanding of the function\
  \ of NAAG and \u03B2-citrylglutamate."
