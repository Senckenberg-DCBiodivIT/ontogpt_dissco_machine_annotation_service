    Sulpiride INDUCES tardive dystonia; Sulpiride treats Pyschosis
  prompt: |
    Sulpiride is a selective D2-receptor antagonist with antipsychotic and antidepressant properties. Although initially thought to be free of extrapyramidal side effects, sulpiride-induced tardive dyskinesia and parkinsonism have been reported occasionally. We studied a 37-year-old man who developed persistent segmental dystonia within 2 months after starting sulpiride therapy. We could not find any previous reports of sulpiride-induced tardive dystonia
