    Text:

    Cortisone acetate binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding
    the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into
    the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE)
    in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts
    with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific
    target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to
    involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition
    arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
    Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which
    then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into
    contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid
    production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed,
    potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation
    Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids.
    Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular
    space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various
    inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis,
    respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal
    enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils,
    macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids
    due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin
    and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference
    with antigen-antibody binding.

    Dione anticonvulsants such as paramethadione reduce T-type calcium currents in

    The mechanism by which felbamate exerts its anticonvulsant activity is unknown,

    receptor binding studies suggest that felbamate may be an antagonist at the strychnine-insensitive
    glycine-recognition site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-ionophore
    complex. Antagonism of the NMDA receptor glycine binding site may block the effects
    of the excitatory amino acids and suppress seizure activity. Animal studies indicate
    that felbamate may increase the seizure threshold and may decrease seizure spread.
    It is also indicated that felbamate has weak inhibitory effects on GABA-receptor

    Salicylic acid directly irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 to decrease conversion
    of arachidonic acid to precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Salicylate''s
    use in rheumatic diseases is due to it''s analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity.
    Salicylic acid is a key ingredient in many skin-care products for the treatment
    of acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, and warts. Salicylic acid
    allows cells of the epidermis to more readily slough off. Because of its effect
    on skin cells, salicylic acid is used in several shampoos used to treat dandruff.
    Salicylic acid is also used as an active ingredient in gels which remove verrucas
    (plantar warts). Salicylic acid competitively inhibits oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose
    (UDPG) with nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) and noncompetitively with
    UDPG. It also competitively inhibits the transferring of the glucuronyl group
    of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) to a phenolic acceptor. Inhibition
    of mucopoly saccharide synthesis is likely responsible for the slowing of wound
    healing with salicylates.

    Text:

    Antagonism at D2 receptors is believed to relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia
    such as delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorders. Perospirone targets
    the mesolimbic patway to reverse the overactivity of the dopaminergic signalling
    via D2 receptors [T28]. 5-HT2A antagonism is thought to allevaite the negative
    symptoms and cognitive impairments of schizophrenia. These receptors are Gi/Go
    coupled receptors that lead to decreased neurotransmitter release and neuronal
    inhibition when activated, thus play a role in dopamine release regulation. Perospirone
    targets these receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway to reduce dopamine release
    and function. In contrast, 5-HT2A receptor antagonism may improve the negative
    symptoms by enhancing dopamine and glutamate release in the mesocortical pathway
    [T28]. 5-HT1A receptor activation further inhibits the release of 5-HT into the
    synaptic cleft.

    Text:

    Fluocinonide is a potent glucocorticoid steroid used topically as anti-inflammatory
    agent for the treatment of skin disorders such as eczema. Fluocinonide binds to
    the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed
    receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds
    to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target
    genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors,
    causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory
    actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2
    inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis
    of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1
    (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase
    A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to
    diminished eicosanoid production. Cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression
    is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In another words, the two main products
    in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of
    Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the
    extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits
    various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis,
    respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal
    enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils,
    macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids
    due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin
    and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference
    with antigen-antibody binding.  Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone
    acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis
    (formation of glycogen). It also promotes the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis),
    and proteins, leading to the mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone
    bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood).
    There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver.

    Text:

    The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general,
    is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase
    A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins.
    It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators
    of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release
    of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from
    membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Alclometasone
    initially binds the corticosteroid receptor. This complex migrates to the nucleus
    where it binds to different glucocorticoid response elements on the DNA. This
    in turn enhances and represses various genes, especially those involved in inflammatory
    pathways.

    Text:

    Digoxin exerts hemodynamic, electrophysiologic, and neurohormonal effects on the
    cardiovascular system.[A178234] It reversibly inhibits the Na-K ATPase enzyme,
    leading to various beneficial effects.  The Na-K ATPase enzyme functions to maintain
    the intracellular environment by regulating the entry and exit of sodium, potassium,
    and calcium (indirectly). Na-K ATPase is also known as the _sodium pump_[L9143].
    The inhibition of the sodium pump by digoxin increases intracellular sodium and
    increases the calcium level in the myocardial cells, causing an increased contractile
    force of the heart.[L9143,A178264] This improves the left ventricular ejection
    fraction (EF), an important measure of cardiac function.[A178234,T613] Digoxin
    also stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system via the vagus nerve[T607] leading
    to sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) node effects, decreasing the heart
    rate.[L9143,A178234] Part of the pathophysiology of heart failure includes neurohormonal
    activation, leading to an increase in norepinephrine. Digoxin helps to decrease
    norepinephrine levels through activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.[A178234]

    function, it stimulates the initial reaction involved in the synthesis of adrenal
    steroids (including cortisol, cortisone, weak androgenic substances, and a limited

    Text:

    Verapamil inhibits L-type calcium channels by binding to a specific area of their
    alpha-1 subunit,[L10478]Cav1.2, which is highly expressed on L-type calcium channels
    in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial tissue where these channels are responsible
    for the control of peripheral vascular resistance and heart contractility.[A175396]
    Calcium influx through these channels allows for the propagation of action potentials
    necessary for the contraction of muscle tissue and the heart''s electrical pacemaker
    activity. Verapamil binds to these channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent
    manner, meaning affinity is increased 1) as vascular smooth muscle membrane potential
    is reduced, and 2) with excessive depolarizing stimulus.[L10478]  Verapamil is
    known to interact with other targets, including other calcium channels,[A188490,A13984,A188502,A15331]

    Text:

    The androgen receptor exists in the cytoplasm bound to the heat shock proteins
    HSP90, HSP70, and other chaperones.[A187114] After binding to an androgen, the
    androgen receptor dissociates from HSP90 and undergoes a conformational change
    to slow the rate of dissociation from the androgen receptor.[A187114] The androgen-receptor
    complex is transported into the nucleus where it binds to DNA and recruits other
    transcriptional regulators to form a pre-initiation complex and eventually induce
    expression of specific genes.[A187114] Antagonism of the androgen receptor is
    also responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics including
    facial and body hair, enlargement of the larynx, thickening of the vocal cords,
    and changes in muscle and fat distribution.[A187111,L8983,L8935,L8938,L8986,L8989,L8992,L8995]

    Text:

    The actions of metolazone result from interference with the renal tubular mechanism
    of electrolyte reabsorption. Metolazone acts primarily to inhibit sodium reabsorption
    at the cortical diluting site and to a lesser extent in the proximal convoluted
    tubule. Sodium and chloride ions are excreted in approximately equivalent amounts.
    The increased delivery of sodium to the distal tubular exchange site results in
    increased potassium excretion. Metolazone does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase.
    The antihypertensive mechanism of action of metolazone is not fully understood
    but is presumed to be related to its saluretic and diuretic properties.

    Text:

    Histamine acts directly on the blood vessels to dilate arteries and capillaries;
    this action is mediated by both H 1- and H 2-receptors. Capillary dilatation may
    produce flushing of the face, a decrease in systemic blood pressure, and gastric
    gland secretion, causing an increased secretion of gastric juice of high acidity.
    Increased capillary permeability accompanies capillary dilatation, producing an
    outward passage of plasma protein and fluid into the extracellular spaces, an
    increase in lymph flow and protein content, and the formation of edema. In addition,
    histamine has a direct stimulant action on smooth muscle, producing contraction
    if H 1-receptors are activated, or mostly relaxation if H 2-receptors are activated.
    Also in humans, the stimulant effect of histamine may cause contraction of the
    intestinal muscle. However, little effect is noticed on the uterus, bladder, or
    gallbladder. Histamine has some stimulant effect on duodenal, salivary, pancreatic,
    bronchial, and lacrimal glands. Histamine also can bind to H3 and H4 receptors
    which are involved in the CNS/PNS neurotransmitter release and immune system chemotaxis,
    respectively.

    Text:

    Cetirizine, a metabolite of _hydroxyzine_, is an antihistamine drug.  Its main
    effects are achieved through selective inhibition of peripheral H1 receptors.
    The antihistamine activity of cetirizine has been shown in a variety of animal
    and human models. _In vivo_ and _ex vivo_ animal models have shown insignificant
    anticholinergic and antiserotonergic effects. In clinical studies, however, dry
    mouth was found to be more frequent with cetirizine than with a placebo. In vitro
    receptor binding studies have demonstrated no detectable affinity of cetirizine
    for histamine receptors  other than the H1 receptors. Studies with radiolabeled
    cetirizine administration in the rat have demonstrated insignificant penetration
    into the brain. _Ex vivo_ studies in the mouse have shown that systemically administered
    cetirizine does not occupy cerebral H1 receptors significantly [FDA label].

    Text:

    Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective
    for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results
    in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet
    lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue
    of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This
    prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops
    the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent
    inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result
    in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions
    such as pulmonary embolism and stroke.  It is important to note that there is
    60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine
    516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to
    the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of
    COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic
    acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule
    inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the
    COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic
    acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325].

    type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum
    located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused
    by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries
    and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release
    of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates
    the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle
    relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition
    of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by avanafil enhances erectile function by increasing

    Text:

    Beclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid and prodrug that is rapidly activated
    by hydrolysis to the active monoester, 17 monopropionate (17-BMP), which mediates
    anti-inflammatory actions. 17-BMP has been shown _in vitro_ to exhibit a binding
    affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately 13 times
    that of dexamethasone and 25 times that of beclomethasone dipropionate.[L6871]
    Upon binding of the ligand, the glucocorticoid receptors dimerize and translocate
    into the nucleus, where they subsequently bind to glucocorticoid response elements
    (GRE) on glucocorticoid-responsive genes, leading to changes in transcription.
    There are several proposed mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids.
    Corticosteroids may work by increasing the transcription of genes coding for anti-inflammatory
    proteins, including lipocortin-1 and interleukin-10.[A179875] Corticosteroids
    were also shown to inhibit the expression of multiple genes that encode pro-inflammatory
    factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, that are activated
    during the chronic inflammatory process.[A31449] This is thought to be due to
    the direct inhibitory interaction between activated glucocorticoid receptors and
    activated pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa
    B and activator protein-1.[A179875] Chronic inflammation is often characterized
    by enhanced expression of these transcription factors that bind to and activate
    coactivator molecules, which then acetylate core histones to switch on gene transcription
    to further amplify the inflammatory process.[A31449] Corticosteroids suppress
    the multiple inflammatory gene expression by promoting histone deacetylation,
    resulting in tighter coiling of DNA and reduced access of transcription factors
    to their binding sites.[A179875]

    Text:

    According to its FDA labeling, acetaminophen''s exact mechanism of action has
    not been fully established[Label] - despite this, it is often categorized alongside
    NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) due to its ability to inhibit the
    cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways.[T518] It is thought to exert central actions which
    ultimately lead to the alleviation of pain symptoms.[T518] One theory is that
    acetaminophen increases the pain threshold by inhibiting two isoforms of cyclooxygenase,
    COX-1 and COX-2, which are involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Prostaglandins
    are responsible for eliciting pain sensations.[A176366] Acetaminophen does not
    inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral
    anti-inflammatory effects. Though acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible
    inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the active site of this enzyme, studies have
    shown that acetaminophen (paracetamol) blocks COX indirectly.[F4133] Studies also
    suggest that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant type of the COX enzyme
    that is unique from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2.[A468] This enzyme has
    been referred to as _COX-3_. The antipyretic actions of acetaminophen are likely
    attributed to direct action on heat-regulating centers in the brain, resulting
    in peripheral vasodilation, sweating, and loss of body heat.[F4133] The exact
    mechanism of action of this drug is not fully understood at this time, but future
    research may contribute to deeper knowledge.[F4133]

    Text:

    In the CNS, there exist strychnine-sensitive glycine binding sites as well as
    strychnine-insensitive glycine binding sites. The strychnine-insensitive glycine-binding
    site is located on the NMDA receptor complex. The strychnine-sensitive glycine
    receptor complex is comprised of a chloride channel and is a member of the ligand-gated
    ion channel superfamily. The putative antispastic activity of supplemental glycine
    could be mediated by glycine''s binding to strychnine-sensitive binding sites
    in the spinal cord. This would result in increased chloride conductance and consequent
    enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission. The ability of glycine to potentiate
    NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission raised the possibility of its use in
    the management of neuroleptic-resistant negative symptoms in schizophrenia. &lt;br/&gt;Animal
    studies indicate that supplemental glycine protects against endotoxin-induced
    lethality, hypoxia-reperfusion injury after liver transplantation, and D-galactosamine-mediated
    liver injury. Neutrophils are thought to participate in these pathologic processes
    via invasion of tissue and releasing such reactive oxygen species as superoxide.
    In vitro studies have shown that neutrophils contain a glycine-gated chloride
    channel that can attenuate increases in intracellular calcium and diminsh neutrophil
    oxidant production. This research is ealy-stage, but suggests that supplementary
    glycine may turn out to be useful in processes where neutrophil infiltration contributes
    to toxicity, such as ARDS.

    Loxoprofen itself is a prodrug and carries little-to-no pharmacological activity
    - it is rapidly metabolized to its trans-alcohol form, which is a potent and non-selective
    inhibitor of cyclooxygenase.[A27797] Cyclooxygenase (COX) is present in 2 forms,
    COX-1 and COX-2, with each serving different functions. COX-1 is present in human
    cells and is constitutively released,  performing cellular housekeeping functions
    such as mucus production and platelet aggregation.[L1228]  COX-2 is induced in
    human cells post-injury or due to other stimuli, is triggered to appear in large
    quantities at the sites of injury/stimuli, and is ultimately responsible for the
    mediation of inflammation and pain.[L1228] Loxoprofen''s active metabolite inhibits
    both COX isoforms, resulting in reduced expression of several mediators of pain,
    inflammation, and fever (e.g. prostaglandins, prostacyclin, thromboxane, etc).[L1228]

    Text:

    The precise mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of topical steroids in
    the treatment of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However,
    corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
    inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. This is achieved first by
    the drug binding to the glucocorticoid receptors which then translocates into
    the nucleus and binds to DNA causing various activations and repressions of genes.
    It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators
    of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release
    of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from
    membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

    Text:

    Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a naturally occurring decapeptide that
    modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. GnRH binds to corresponding
    receptors (GnRHRs) on the anterior pituitary gonadotropes, which in turn release
    luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); these, in turn,
    affect the downstream synthesis and release of the sex hormones testosterone,
    dihydrotestosterone, estrone, and estradiol.[A203126, A203132] Despite the variety
    of conditions indicated for treatment with leuprolide, the mechanism of action
    underlying efficacy is the same in all cases. As a GnRHR agonist, leuprolide binds
    to and initially activates downstream LH and FSH release; this initial spike in
    gonadotropin levels is responsible for some of the adverse effects associated
    with treatment. After 2-4 weeks of treatment, continuous stimulation of GnRHR
    results in feedback inhibition and significant downregulation of LH, FSH, and
    their corresponding downstream effects, producing a therapeutic benefit. These
    effects are reversible upon treatment discontinuation.[A203126, A203129, A203132,
    A203222, L10310, L13781, L13784, L13787, L13790, L13814]
