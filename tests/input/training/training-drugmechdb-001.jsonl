These receptors are Gi/Go coupled receptors that lead to decreased neurotransmitter release and neuronal inhibition when activated, thus play a role in dopamine release regulation. Perospirone targets these receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway to reduce dopamine release and function. In contrast, 5-HT2A receptor antagonism may improve the negative symptoms by enhancing dopamine and glutamate release in the mesocortical pathway [T28]. 5-HT1A receptor activation further inhibits the release of 5-HT into the synaptic cleft.\n\n===\n\ndisease: Schizophrenia\ndrug: Perospirone\n", "completion": "'disease: Schizophrenia\n\n  drug: Perospirone\n\n  mechanism_links: perospirone - increases activity of - 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor\n  1A (human); perospirone - decreases activity of - D(2) dopamine receptor (human);\n  perospirone - decreases activity of - 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (human); 5-hydroxytryptamine\n  receptor 1A (human) - negatively correlated with - HP:0000739; 5-hydroxytryptamine\n  receptor 2A (human) - positively regulates - dopamine secretion; 5-hydroxytryptamine\n  receptor 2A (human) - positively regulates - glutamate secretion; glutamate secretion\n  - positively correlated with - dopamine neurotransmitter receptor activity; dopamine\n  neurotransmitter receptor activity - positively correlated with - HP:0000709; D(2)\n  dopamine receptor (human) - positively regulates - dopamine secretion; dopamine\n  secretion - increases abundance of - dopamine; dopamine - located in - medial forebrain\n  bundle; medial forebrain bundle - correlated with - HP:0000709; HP:0000709 - positively\n  correlated with - Schizophrenia; dopamine - located in - dorsolateral prefrontal\n  cortex; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - correlated with - HP:0100543; dorsolateral\n  prefrontal cortex - correlated with - HP:0030213; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\n  - correlated with - HP:0012154; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - correlated with\n  - HP:0002465; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - correlated with - HP:0000741; HP:0100543\n  - manifestation of - Schizophrenia; HP:0030213 - manifestation of - Schizophrenia;\n  HP:0012154 - manifestation of - Schizophrenia; HP:0002465 - manifestation of - Schizophrenia;\n  HP:0000741 - manifestation of - Schizophrenia; HP:0000739 - manifestation of - Schizophrenia'\n"}

Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen).

If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane [F3088],[F3100]. Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone‐like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth [A174094]. Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as _CYP51_) [A174094] is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects.

It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke.  It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268].

There are several proposed mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may work by increasing the transcription of genes coding for anti-inflammatory proteins, including lipocortin-1 and interleukin-10.[A179875] Corticosteroids were also shown to inhibit the expression of multiple genes that encode pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, that are activated during the chronic inflammatory process.[A31449] This is thought to be due to the direct inhibitory interaction between activated glucocorticoid receptors and activated pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1.[A179875] Chronic inflammation is often characterized by enhanced expression of these transcription factors that bind to and activate coactivator molecules, which then acetylate core histones to switch on gene transcription to further amplify the inflammatory process.[A31449] Corticosteroids suppress the multiple inflammatory gene expression by promoting histone deacetylation, resulting in tighter coiling of DNA and reduced access of transcription factors to their binding sites.[A179875]\n\n===\n\ndisease: Nasal Polyps\ndrug: Beclomethasone dipropionate\n", "completion": "'disease: Nasal Polyps\n\n  drug: Beclomethasone dipropionate\n\n  mechanism_links: Beclomethasone dipropionate - has metabolite - CHEBI:3001; CHEBI:3001\n  - positively regulates - glucocorticoid receptor (human); glucocorticoid receptor\n  (human) - negatively regulates - inflammatory response; inflammatory response -\n  positively correlated with - Nasal Polyps'\n"}

Prostaglandins are responsible for eliciting pain sensations.[A176366] Acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. Though acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the active site of this enzyme, studies have shown that acetaminophen (paracetamol) blocks COX indirectly.[F4133] Studies also suggest that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant type of the COX enzyme that is unique from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2.[A468] This enzyme has been referred to as _COX-3_. The antipyretic actions of acetaminophen are likely attributed to direct action on heat-regulating centers in the brain, resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating, and loss of body heat.[F4133] The exact mechanism of action of this drug is not fully understood at this time, but future research may contribute to deeper knowledge.[F4133]\n\n===\n\ndisease: Rhinitis, Allergic\ndrug: Acetaminophen\n", "completion": "'disease: Rhinitis, Allergic\n\n  drug: Acetaminophen\n\n  mechanism_links: Acetaminophen - decreases activity of - prostaglandin G/H synthase\n  1 (human); Acetaminophen - decreases activity of - prostaglandin G/H synthase 2\n  (human); Acetaminophen - decreases activity of - prostaglandin E synthase 3 (human);\n  prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 (human) - positively regulates - prostaglandin biosynthetic\n  process; prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (human) - positively regulates - prostaglandin\n  biosynthetic process; prostaglandin E synthase 3 (human) - positively regulates\n  - prostaglandin biosynthetic process; prostaglandin biosynthetic process - increases\n  abundance of - Prostaglandins; Prostaglandins - positively correlated with - Rhinitis,\n  Allergic'\n"}

Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks. This ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which leads to the induction of replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks, the formation of this ternary complex eventually leads to apoptosis (programmed cell death). Topotecan mimics a DNA base pair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating between the upstream (−1) and downstream (+1) base pairs. Intercalation displaces the downstream DNA, thus preventing religation of the cleaved strand. By specifically binding to the enzyme–substrate complex, Topotecan acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor.\n\n===\n\ndisease: Small Cell Lung Carcinoma\ndrug: Topotecan\n", "completion": "'disease: Small Cell Lung Carcinoma\n\n  drug: Topotecan\n\n  mechanism_links: Topotecan - decreases activity of - DNA topoisomerase 1 (human);\n  DNA topoisomerase 1 (human) - positively regulates - DNA binding; DNA binding -\n  correlated with - DNA replication; DNA replication - positively correlated with\n  - neoplastic cell; neoplastic cell - positively correlated with - Small Cell Lung\n  Carcinoma'\n"}

The strychnine-insensitive glycine-binding site is located on the NMDA receptor complex. The strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor complex is comprised of a chloride channel and is a member of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. The putative antispastic activity of supplemental glycine could be mediated by glycine's binding to strychnine-sensitive binding sites in the spinal cord. This would result in increased chloride conductance and consequent enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission. The ability of glycine to potentiate NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission raised the possibility of its use in the management of neuroleptic-resistant negative symptoms in schizophrenia. &lt;br/&gt;Animal studies indicate that supplemental glycine protects against endotoxin-induced lethality, hypoxia-reperfusion injury after liver transplantation, and D-galactosamine-mediated liver injury. Neutrophils are thought to participate in these pathologic processes via invasion of tissue and releasing such reactive oxygen species as superoxide. In vitro studies have shown that neutrophils contain a glycine-gated chloride channel that can attenuate increases in intracellular calcium and diminsh neutrophil oxidant production. This research is ealy-stage, but suggests that supplementary glycine may turn out to be useful in processes where neutrophil infiltration contributes to toxicity, such as ARDS.\n\n===\n\ndisease: Common Cold\ndrug: Glycine\n", "completion": "'disease: Common Cold\n\n  drug: Glycine\n\n  mechanism_links: Glycine - treats - Common Cold'\n"}

As a GnRHR agonist, leuprolide binds to and initially activates downstream LH and FSH release; this initial spike in gonadotropin levels is responsible for some of the adverse effects associated with treatment. After 2-4 weeks of treatment, continuous stimulation of GnRHR results in feedback inhibition and significant downregulation of LH, FSH, and their corresponding downstream effects, producing a therapeutic benefit.

Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.\n\n===\n\ndisease: Tendinopathy\ndrug: Sulindac\n", "completion": "'disease: Tendinopathy\n\n  drug: Sulindac\n\n  mechanism_links: Sulindac - decreases activity of - prostaglandin G/H synthase 1\n  (human); Sulindac - decreases activity of - prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (human);\n  prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 (human) - increases abundance of - Prostaglandins;\n  prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (human) - increases abundance of - Prostaglandins;\n  Prostaglandins - participates in - inflammatory response; inflammatory response\n  - contributes to - Pain; Pain - manifestation of - Tendinopathy'\n"}
