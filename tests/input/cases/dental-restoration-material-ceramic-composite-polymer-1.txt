 OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate the One-step No-prep treatment of full mouth-worn dentition, a minimally invasive and multidisciplinary approach using PICN CAD-CAM composite restorations without provisional phase. 
 METHODS: Seven patients (n = 192 restorations) with severe tooth wear were included. Patient data were recorded, and an occlusal analysis and a tissue-guided wax-up were realized. After replacement of old fillings, no-prep Vita Enamic restorations (posterior restorations and palatal veneers) were bonded within 24 h. Direct composites were performed to mask the buccal joint on anterior teeth. Maxillo-facial physiotherapy was performed. Restorations were evaluated following World Dental Federation criteria. Treatment influence on Oral-Health-Impact-Profile-49 (OHIP-49) score was assessed. 
 RESULTS: Tooth wear etiology was related to soft drink consumption and bruxism. Mean VDO increase was 5.09 ± 0.85 mm on the incisal pin. The mean restoration thickness on molars was 0.55 ± 0.21 mm, and the lowest was 0.11 mm. 2-year survival rate of restorations was 100 % and success rate was 93.5 %, with 11 minor chippings and one debonding. A significant improvement of the global OHIP-49 score was observed. 
 CONCLUSIONS: In this clinical study on high risk patients, PICN restorations, applied in a minimally invasive way, showed high survival and success rates after two years, while minor chipping of very thin occlusal borders constituted the most frequent complication. Moreover, the patient acceptance was good according to OHIP-49 in this multidisciplinary approach. 
 CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of PICNs allows the development of no prep and simple treatment protocols of worn dentition. The absence of provisionals did not engender any problem, on the basis of the realization of an occlusal analysis, the support of a maxillo-facial physiotherapist, and the use of an easy-to-adjust restorative material.
