 AIMS: To evaluate the effect of two composite restorative techniques (direct bulk fill vs indirect CAD/CAM) on the fracture resistance and mode of fracture of extended mesio-occlusal-distal (MOD) cavity preparations. 
 METHODS: Fifty-one sound human mandibular third molars were divided into three groups (n=17). Extended bucco-lingual MOD cavities were prepared. Teeth in group 1 were restored with a bulk-fill resin composite (Filtek Bulk-Fill Posterior Restorative), teeth in group 2 were restored with composite computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) inlays (Lava Ultimate), and teeth in group 3 served as control and remained intact. All specimens were submitted to thermocycling, and a fracture resistance test was performed using a Universal testing machine (0.5 mm/min). Mode of fracture was classified into five types. One-way analysis of variance and the Duncan test were used to analyze the fracture load data at a significance level of α = 0.05. A chi-square test was used for the analysis of fracture mode between the restorative groups. 
 RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed significant differences in fracture resistance among the experimental groups. The teeth restored with the bulk-fill composite exhibited lower fracture resistance (1285.3±655.0 N) when compared to the teeth restored with the composite CAD/CAM inlays (1869.8±529.4 N) (p<0.05). Mode of fracture showed the same distribution between the restorative groups. 
 CONCLUSIONS: Although both types of restorations failed at loads larger than those found in the oral cavity, the CAD/CAM composite inlays increased the fracture resistance of teeth with large MOD cavities when compared to direct bulk-fill composite restorations. The majority of fracture types were intraorally repairable for both restorative techniques.
